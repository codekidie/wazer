                        <p>Statement of the Problem
The researchers through the survey conducted found out that despite the government and private schools effort to provide the students a career assessment test to help them decide what career to pursue in college, there are still numerous instances where students shift program because of difficulty in their subject and difficulty in finding a career to pursue. 
These are the following major problems that the researchers are trying to address: </p>
<ul>
  <li>1.  Some students are struggling to choose a career that someday the students can passionately pursue in the future.</li>
  <li>2.  Most of the career assessment test are structured pencil and paper exercises which tend to be unappealing to the students and the tendency one will not complete the test or take the test seriously.</li>
</ul>
